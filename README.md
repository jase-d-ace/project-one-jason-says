# Turtle Project One: Quick and Simple Simon Says
## by Jason Andrada
My first solo project!!

## Rules of the Game:

* Follow a computer-generated series of flashing lights
* Click on the lights in the right order to score a point.
* Getting to 4 will make the squares shift to the left
* Getting to 7 will make the colors change
* Getting to 10 will trigger a strobe light in the back

## Perceived Problems: 

* Getting the lights to flash in a truly random order
* Figuring out how to smoothly add more and more colors as the game progresses
* Styling might be tricky if the boxes donâ€™t line up correctly

## Unsolved Problems: 

* One of the difficulty increasers I wanted to use required the use of $('selector').effect('shake), which is not available in standard jQuery.
    * One of the methods I tried to overcome this ended up making the game run wonky due to the interaction between intervals



## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS (specifically flexbox)
* jQuery for logic
* wireframes.cc for wire framing
